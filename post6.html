        <p>Machu Picchu, perched high in the Andes Mountains of Peru, is one of the most mysterious and fascinating archaeological sites in the world. This ancient Incan city has captivated travelers and historians alike for centuries.</p>

        <h2>The History of Machu Picchu</h2>
        <p>Believed to have been built in the 15th century during the reign of the Incan emperor Pachacuti, Machu Picchu was likely used as a royal estate or religious site. Its remote location helped protect it from Spanish colonizers, and it was "discovered" by the Western world in 1911 by explorer Hiram Bingham.</p>

        <h2>Key Highlights to Explore</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Temple of the Sun:</strong> A sacred site within Machu Picchu, believed to be used for astronomical and religious purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Intihuatana Stone:</strong> A carved stone often described as a sun dial, which the Incas used for astronomical observations.</li>
            <li><strong>The Terraces:</strong> Ingeniously constructed agricultural terraces that allowed the Incas to farm in the steep Andean mountains.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Travel Tips for Machu Picchu</h2>
        <p>When visiting Machu Picchu, it's recommended to book your tickets in advance as daily visitor numbers are limited. The best time to visit is during the dry season (April to October) to avoid heavy rains. Don't forget to bring comfortable walking shoes for the steep and uneven paths!</p>
